# Welcome to the Vapory Wiki


This is the community-maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the next-generation peer-to-peer technology platform build by ÐΞV including **Vapory**, _the generalized blockchain for smart contract development_, and **Whisper**, _the private low-level datagram communication platform_.

Users signed in with GitHub can edit and add pages using the [browser](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-wiki-pages-via-the-online-interface) or [locally](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally).

## Status 

### Frontier

Version 1.0 of Vapory aka Frontier was released on July 30th 2015! Development continues towards the versions named Homestead, Metropolis and Serenity (v1.1). Frontier is aimed at exchangers and [miners](https://github.com/vaporyco/wiki/wiki/Mining). Homestead is aiming for [Ðapps developers](https://github.com/vaporyco/wiki/wiki/Vapory-Development-Tutorial), while Metropolis is aiming for end users with the release of the Mist browser. Serenity is meant to move from consensus through [Proof-of-Work](https://github.com/vaporyco/wiki/wiki/Vapash) to [Proof-of-Stake](https://blog.vapory.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/).
